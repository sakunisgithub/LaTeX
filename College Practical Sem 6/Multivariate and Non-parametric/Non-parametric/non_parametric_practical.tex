	\item A manufacturer of electric bulbs claims that he has developed a new production process which will increase the average efficiency (in suitable units) from the present value of $9.03$. The results obtained from an experiment with 15 bulbs from the new process are given as follows :

	\item The following are the marks secured by two batches of salesmen in the final test taken after completion of training. Use an appropriate non-parametric test with $\alpha = 0.02$ for the null hypothesis that the samples are drawn from identical distributions against the alternative that the distributions differ in location only. \\
	
	Batch $A$ : 26, 27, 31, 26, 19, 21, 20, 25, 30; \\

	\item Some depressed people were found, and it was checked that initially they were all equivalently depressed. Then each person was allocated randomly to one of three groups: no exercise; 20 minutes of jogging per day; or 60 minutes of jogging per day. At the end of a month, each participant was asked to rate how depressed they now feel on a Likert scale that runs from 1 (totally miserable) through to 100 (ecstatically happy). \\
