\section*{A. TEST OF SIGNIFICANCE}


\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item The following are 12 determinations of the melting point of a compound (in degree Celsius) made by an analyst, the true melting point being 165$^\circ{}$ C. Would you conclude from these data that his determinations are free from bias ?

\begin{center}
164.4, 169.7, 163.9, 162.1, 160.9, 160.8, 161.4, 162.2, 168.5, 163.4, 162.9, 167.7
\end{center}







\item A manufacturer, producing foot scales has installed a new system in his factory in order to limit the variation in lengths of scales. The lengths (in inches) of 12 scales produced according to the new system are given as :

	\begin{center}
		12.19, 11.81, 12.10, 12.02, 12.25, 11.80, 12.06, 11.98, 11.90, 12.00, 11.85, 12.01
	\end{center}

The variance of lengths of scales produced by the previous system has been found to be 0.12 inch. Test whether the new system seems to be superior than the previous.










\item Samples of wood were obtained from the core and periphery of a certain Byzantine Church. The date of the wood was giving the following data : \\

Core :- 1294, 1279, 1274, 1264, 1263, 1254, 1251, 1251, 1240, 1232, 1220, 1218, 1210 \\

Periphery :- 1284, 1272, 1256, 1254, 1242, 1274, 1264, 1256, 1250 \\

Determine if the mean age of the core is same as the mean age of the periphery.







\item Two independent samples from two different populations of infants were taken. For all sample infants, the ages (in months) at which they walked alone were recorded as below : \\

Sample from Population 1 : 9.5, 10.5, 9.0, 9.75, 10.0, 13.0, 10.1, 13.5, 10.2, 9.51, 9.9, 9.78 \\

Sample from Population 2 : 12.5, 9.45, 11.52, 11.75, 10.12, 9.85, 10.35, 9.55, 9.05, 11.49, 12.10, 9.10 \\

Assuming two populations to be normally distributed with same location, test whether the populations are identical.
